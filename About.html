                    <p>Iloilo, situated in the heart of the Philippine archipelago, is a province within Panay Island's
                        southeastern region, bordered by the island-province of Guimaras. The bustling City of Iloilo
                        serves as both the provincial capital and a prominent urban hub in the Philippines, earning it
                        the moniker "the Heart of the Philippines.".
                    </p>

                    <h2>Heritage</h2>

                        landscape.
                    </p>
                    <p>The vibrant heritage of Iloilo finds expression through a diverse array of festivals held across
                        the city and its surrounding towns. Renowned as the "Province of Festivals," Iloilo takes pride
                        in its internationally recognized Dinagyang Festival. Alongside this celebrated event are
                        numerous smaller yet equally captivating festivals throughout the province, where the fusion of
                        pagan and Christian traditions unfolds in lively street dances paying homage to Sto. Niño.
                    </p>

                        feels like they are serenading you with a love song, making it difficult to discern if they are
                        upset. In the rural areas of Iloilo, Kiniray-a, a dialect similar to Hiligaynon, is commonly
                        used. Additionally, English and Tagalog are widely spoken and understood, particularly in urban
                        centers.</p>
